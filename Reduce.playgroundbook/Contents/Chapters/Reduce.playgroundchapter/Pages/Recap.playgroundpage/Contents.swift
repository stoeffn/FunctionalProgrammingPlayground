 # Recap 🎓

 Functional programming provides concise ways for declarativly expressing a problem rather than the solution, which can help you *reduce* [boilerplate code](glossary://boilerplate%20code). If this tip of the iceberg got you intrigued you should definitly check out more tutorials on this topic 😉
 
 # Making It Even Simpler 😱
 
 Using the power of Swift, you can simplify your code even more! Notice the [implicit closure parameters](glossary://implicit%20closure%20parameter) and reference to the `max`-function?

 **Just play around and apply what you've learned ☺️**
 
 *The animation on the right will adapt automatically to your code. Maybe try adding new operations?*

 *I hope you enjoyed my Swift Playground—Thanks for considering me!*
